Not complete, and mentions some stuff which already is done

3.1.2 Data representation
  Fundamental types
    - (IEEE) layout of float, double, long double, __float128
    - _Bool traits
    - check that 10 byte padding of long double doesn't affect semantic
    - layout check for __int128 (little endian in memory)
    - null pointer for all types has value zero
    - size_t is defined to unsigned long
    - layout of _Bools (0/1-ness), and when passing in regs as args (see
      mail discussion)
    - alignment of data is not needed but preferred --> check it
    - alignment of __m128 is required

  Aggregates and unions
    - structs and unions assume alignment of most strictly aligned
      member
    - size of any object is always multiple of its alignment
    - arrays > 16 bytes or VLA arrays have 16 byte alignment
    - other arrays have same alignment as elements
    - contents of padding is undefined (check that it doesn't change semantic)

  Bitfields
    - when not signed or unsigned, they are unsigned
    - check ranges of bitfields?
    - allocated from left to right
    - in a storage unit appropriate for its declared type
    - unnamed bitfields do not affect alignment of struct or union

3.2.1 Registers and Stack Frame
  - check caller/callee saveness (part asm)
  - CPU shall be in x87 mode at function entry (asm)
  - direction flag must be clear at function entry (asm)

3.2.2 Stack Frame
  - end of input area is 16-byte aligned (asm)
  - check red zone is not destroyed by signal handlers (asm)?

3.2.3 Parameter Passing
  - passing of basic types
  - passing of __int128, __float128
  - passing of __complex types
  - passing of structs
  - passing of structs where two eightbytes are in different classes
  - passing of structs where multiple member are in one eightbyte
  - passing of arguments needing more than one reg, where only one is
    free (should be in memory then), this register is then free again
  - passing like the ABI example (figures 3.5, 3.6)
  - returning of basic types
  - returning of __int128, __float128
  - returning of __complex types
  - returning of structs (hidden param and %rax holding address)
  - returning of unions?
  - varargs set %al

3.4 Process Initialization
3.4.1 Initial Stack and Register State
  - check that SSE and x87 exceptions status is cleared at program start
    (no GCC test)
  - check that control words have the correct content (table 3.3 and 3.4)
    (no GCC test)
  - check content of DF flag (must be zero on entry and exit of functions)

3.5 Coding Examples
3.5.7 Variable Argument Lists
  - create check as per figures 3.31 and 3.32
  - check layout of register save area (get to it by the va_start macro)

Medium Model
  - large objects should be in .lbss/.ldata
  - large objects with small model should _not_ be in .lbss/.ldata
  - large objects should _not_ be declarable in small model
  - -G SIZE should have an effect with ld
  - test uninit data (.*bss) and inited data (.*data)
  - test static and non-static global objects
  - test arrays or structs containing big arrays
  - test multiple large arrays
  - create various access to the elements: explicit pointers, direct
    array/member accesses
  - debug info correct for large objects?
