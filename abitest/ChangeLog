2005-05-24  Michael Matz  <matz@suse.de>

	* abitest: Tests which can not run when optimized can now with
	a comment make sure not to be run with certain optimization levels.
	Also, -O3 levels have been removed. Inlining doesn't make sense for
	most tests.

	and -O2.
	* test_passing_unions.c: Likewise.
	* test_passing_structs_and_unions.c: Likewise.

	individually in simics instead of as one big executable.

2001-04-11  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.co.uk>

	* defines.h: Add setting for checks of float and double passing.
	Add setting for checks of returning complex types.

2001-02-28  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_struct_passing): Hardware registers should be
	cleared after setting the struct entries.
	(struniargs): Enable union passing test.
	* make_returning2.c: Bugfixed two-words types. Previously there was
	a workaround that only worked for long long. Now it works for other
	types too.
	* defines.h: Enable all long double tests.
	* Makefile: Change to using simics
	* runtime.abitest: Simics script added.
	* abitest.conf: Simics runtime configuration file added.

	* struniargs.c (struniargs): Temporarily disabled union test.

	* defines.h: Enabled more tests and added new CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE.
	* sizal.c: Fixed alignment/size testing for arrays and structs.
	* struniargs.c: Fix testing larger structs, larger unions and
	mixed passing.

2000-12-15  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

2000-12-13  Bo Thorsen  <bo@dsuse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_union_passing): Added union passing test

	* variargs.c: Bugfixed; now works with gcc2.95.2 on ia32 but still
	fails on x86-64. Probably not a varargs related problem any more.

	* make_sizal2.c (main): Implemented union size tests
	* struniargs.c: Moved structargs.c to struniargs.c, cleanup and
	expansion of the test
