	* abitest: Tests which can not run when optimized can now with
	a comment make sure not to be run with certain optimization levels.
	Also, -O3 levels have been removed. Inlining doesn't make sense for
	most tests.

	and -O2.
	* test_passing_unions.c: Likewise.

	individually in simics instead of as one big executable.

2001-04-11  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.co.uk>

2001-02-28  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_struct_passing): Hardware registers should be
	cleared after setting the struct entries.
	(struniargs): Enable union passing test.
	* make_returning2.c: Bugfixed two-words types. Previously there was
	a workaround that only worked for long long. Now it works for other
	types too.
	* defines.h: Enable all long double tests.
	* Makefile: Change to using simics
	* runtime.abitest: Simics script added.
	* abitest.conf: Simics runtime configuration file added.
	* abitest: Script to run the abitest in simics added.

	test.
	* returning.c: Add return value test file.
	* Makefile: Add return value test.

	* reloc.c (reloc): Fix the comments to show that this is for now
	just a compiling and linking test.

	* struniargs.c (struniargs): Temporarily disabled union test.

		tests scalar argument passing.
	* args.h: Fix formatting.
	Start split to do both integer and float testing.
	Add float passing check - for the moment just no-op macros.
	* funcs.h (test_return): Add autogenerated tests from make_scalarargs2.
	* typelist.c: File added. Sets the lists for autogenerated types tests.
	* typelist.h: File added.

2001-01-26  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* sizal.c: Rearrange to increase granularity of the tests.
	* macros.h (check_array_size_and_align): Fix for arrays of pointers.
	(check_array_size_and_align): Add array in struct size and align test.

2001-01-23  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* macros.h: Added file. Moved a couple of macros to this file.

	* main.c (main): Added bitfield test.
	* funcs.h: Likewise.
	* sizal.c: Removed bitfield test.

2000-12-17  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* defines.h: Enabled more tests and added new CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE.
	* sizal.c: Fixed alignment/size testing for arrays and structs.
	* struniargs.c: Fix testing larger structs, larger unions and
	mixed passing.

2000-12-15  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* variargs.c, defines.h: Enable varargs test

2000-12-13  Bo Thorsen  <bo@dsuse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_union_passing): Added union passing test

	* variargs.c: Bugfixed; now works with gcc2.95.2 on ia32 but still
	fails on x86-64. Probably not a varargs related problem any more.

	* make_sizal2.c (main): Implemented union size tests
	* struniargs.c: Moved structargs.c to struniargs.c, cleanup and
	expansion of the test

	* defines.h: Defines for dis-/enabling parts of the test
