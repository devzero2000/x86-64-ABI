2001-02-15  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* make_returning2.c: Added file. Used to construct the return value
	test.
	* returning.c: Add return value test file.
	* Makefile: Add return value test.

2001-02-14  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* Makefile: Add reloc2.s compilation and linking test.
	* reloc2.s: Added file to test compilation and linking of relocations.
	* reloc.c (reloc): Fix the comments to show that this is for now
	just a compiling and linking test.

2001-02-01  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* struniargs.c (struniargs): Temporarily disabled union test.
	* scalarargs.c: Move all tests to the autogenerated scalarargs2.c.
	* make_scalarargs2.c: Added file. Will produce a scalarargs2.c which
		tests scalar argument passing.
	* args.h: Fix formatting.
	Start split to do both integer and float testing.
	Add float passing check - for the moment just no-op macros.
	* funcs.h (test_return): Add autogenerated tests from make_scalarargs2.
	* typelist.c: File added. Sets the lists for autogenerated types tests.
	* typelist.h: File added.
	* make_sizal2.c: Use typelist files.
	* defines.h: Added defines for building lists of types to be checked.
	* main.c: Fix formatting.

2001-01-26  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* sizal.c: Rearrange to increase granularity of the tests.
	* macros.h (check_array_size_and_align): Fix for arrays of pointers.
	(check_array_size_and_align): Add array in struct size and align test.
	* defines.h: Make defines with size and alignment of scalar types.

2001-01-25  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* Multiple files: Fix formatting.

	* funcs.h (sizal2): Add sizal2 forward declaration.

	* sizal.c (check_struct_and_union3): Remove CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE check.
	* make_sizal2.c (main): Fix calculation of struct size.
	(calculate_struct_size): Do calculation of struct size.
	(main): Change output format to that of a complete c source file.

	* defines.h: Removed no longer used CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE.

2001-01-23  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* macros.h: Added file. Moved a couple of macros to this file.
	* bitfields.c: Added test for bitfield structs and unions.
	* main.c (main): Added bitfield test.
	* funcs.h: Likewise.
	* sizal.c: Removed bitfield test.

2000-12-17  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* defines.h: Enabled more tests and added new CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE.
	* sizal.c: Fixed alignment/size testing for arrays and structs.
	* struniargs.c: Fix testing larger structs, larger unions and
	mixed passing.

2000-12-15  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* variargs.c, defines.h: Enable varargs test

2000-12-13  Bo Thorsen  <bo@dsuse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_union_passing): Added union passing test

	* variargs.c: Bugfixed; now works with gcc2.95.2 on ia32 but still
	fails on x86-64. Probably not a varargs related problem any more.

	* make_sizal2.c (main): Implemented union size tests
	* struniargs.c: Moved structargs.c to struniargs.c, cleanup and
	expansion of the test

	* defines.h: Defines for dis-/enabling parts of the test

2000-12-10  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>

	* Small changes that should have made it for the initial release.

2000-12-07  Bo Thorsen  <bo@suse.de>
