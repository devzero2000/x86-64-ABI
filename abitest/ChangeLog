	* defines.h: Enabled more tests and added new CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE.

	* variargs.c, defines.h: Enable varargs test

2000-12-13  Bo Thorsen  <bo@dsuse.de>

	* struniargs.c (test_union_passing): Added union passing test

	* variargs.c: Bugfixed; now works with gcc2.95.2 on ia32 but still
	fails on x86-64. Probably not a varargs related problem any more.

	* make_sizal2.c (main): Implemented union size tests
	* struniargs.c: Moved structargs.c to struniargs.c, cleanup and
	expansion of the test

	* defines.h: Defines for dis-/enabling parts of the test
