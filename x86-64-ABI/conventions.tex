\editornote{This chapter is used to document some features special to
  the \xARCH ABI.  The different sections might be moved to another
  place or removed completly.}


\section{GOT pointer and IP relative addressing}

\index{global offset table}
A basic difference between the i386 ABI and the \xARCH ABI is the
way the GOT table is found.  The i386 ABI, like (most) other processor
specific ABIs, uses a dedicated register (\reg{EBX}) to address the
base of the GOT table.  The function prologue of every function needs
to set up this register to the correct value.  The \xARCH processor
family introduces a new IP-relative addressing mode which is used in
this ABI instead of a using a dedicated register.

\section{Execution of 32bit programs}

The \xARCH is able to execute 64 bit \xARCH and also 32 bit ia32
programs.  Libraries and programs conforming to the \xARCH ABI will
live in the normal places like \path{/usr/lib} and \path{/usr/bin}.
Programs following the 32 bit ia32 ABI (known as i386 ABI), will use
the subdirectories of \path{/usr/ia32}, e.g \path{/usr/ia32/lib} for
libraries and \path{/usr/ia32/bin} for binaries.  The location of the
program interpreter for ia32 binaries is not changed.
