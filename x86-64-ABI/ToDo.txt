This file documents a number of open topics in the ABI:

- Structure passing is implemented differently in GCC than specified
  in the ABI.  Either has to be changed and some unclear wording and
  the ABI needs to get resolved.

- Geert Bosch has a number of smaller nitpits.  Let's get hold of them
  and integrate them.

- Check layout.  All figures should look the same

- Run a spell checker on the document.

- Proof-read and check english, most of us aren't native speakers.

- Should we enforce alignment for SSE?

- Should we declare some global XMM registers?

- Define values of FPU control words

- The figure "Stack Frame" should be clarified: %rbp is optional

- Is vararg passing really the same as non-vararg passing?  Is this
  handled correctly?

- Check that all examples are correct according to the ABI.

- Define Exception handling (see Geert's proposal)

- Add more examples
