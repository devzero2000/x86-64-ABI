\chapter{Introduction}

Except where otherwise noted, the \xARCH architecture follows the
conventions described in the Intel386 psABI.  Rather than replicate
the entire contents of the Intel386 psABI document, this document
simply indicates the differences from that document.  The ABI
described in this document applies only to the \xARCH architecture
when it is executing in 32/64-bit mode; when the architecture executes
in ordinary 32-bit mode the Intel386 psABI conventions apply.

As with all psABI documents, no attempt has been made to specify an
ABI for languages other than C.  However, it is assumed that many
programming languages will wish to link with code written in C, so
that the ABI specifications documented here are relevant.%
\footnote{See section \ref{section-cpp} for details on C++ ABI.}

\section{Differences from the Intel386 psABI}

The most fundamental differences from the Intel386 psABI document
are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to sizes of fundamental data types.
\item Changes to calling conventions.
\item Changes to the floating-point support.
\item Removal of the GOT register.
\item Use RELA instead of REL relocations.
\end{itemize}
