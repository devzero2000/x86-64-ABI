\chapter{Introduction}

Except where otherwise noted, the x86-64 architecture follows the
conventions described in the Intel386 psABI.  Rather than replicate
the entire contents of the Intel386 psABI document, this document
simply indicates the differences from that document.

\editornote{The following paragraphs might disappear again - for now
  they should avoid confusion}.
The \xARCH architecture defines a new mode, referred to as 32/64-bit
mode. All information in this document is relevant only to 32/64-bit
mode, unless stated otherwise.

This ABI specifies the language bindings for the C language except
where noted explicitly.
\editornote{For C++ we will use ia64 C++ ABI.}

\section{Major differences to i386 ABI}

The major differences of the \xARCH ABI to the i386 ABI are as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 64 bit code and data model
\item No explicit GOT register
\item different function calling conventions due to more registers
\item Usage of SSE/SSE2 for floating point
\item 128 bit long double floating point type. \editornote{This needs
    further discussion.}
\end{itemize}
